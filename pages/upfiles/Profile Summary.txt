I am looking forward for an opportunity to ride my career as Java developer or a Web Developer and to learn, test and enhance my skills and knowledge with an reputed firm driven by technology. My domain expertise are in Core Java and I also had knowledge about the frontend technologies like HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP Framework and I am familier with SQL queries as well. Along with that I am adaptable, teamplayer and always ready for relocation and I had completed two minor projects, first one is an photographer's website and other is an live project which is an International conference site (ICMMT-2022). 



Resume:
Weakness: I take too much responsibilities
